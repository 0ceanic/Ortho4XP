# Ortho4XP - Unofficial Norway Source Hack
Ortho4XP is a scenery generator for the X-Plane flight simulator, written by _**Oscar Pilote**_

**Please be aware that THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL Ortho4XP**.

This version/branch contains a crude hack (courtesy of [Jaromaz](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/188035-jaromaz/) with minor modifications by [Daikan](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/269990-daikan/)) which tries to work around the broken Norway (NO) source.

Known issues:

- Ortho4XP may not shut down properly and requires a forced termination of the Python process.

**It may or may not work** for you, as this is all a work in progress for now.
